Buy - sell scenario

1. At t=0, base price.

2. Check at t=dn  #where dn is the minimum time gap between two api call for that stock
    a) If the current price is < 1.005 times the base price, start from step 1.
    b) If the current price >= 1.005 times the base price, buy the stock.
    Make current price the base price.
    Put the stop loss at 0.995 times the current base price until the price goes to 1.01 times the base price.

3. Check at t=2dn
    a) If the current price goes between 1.01(gain = 1%) and 1.03(gain = 3%) times the base price, set the stop loss at (.5 * gain + 1) times the base price
    b) If the current price goes above 1.03 times the base price, set the stop loss at (gain - 1% + 1) times the base price.
    c) If the current price goes to 0.995, it'll sell the stock and start from step 1.
